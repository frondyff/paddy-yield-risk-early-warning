# paddy-yield-risk-early-warning
This project builds an **early warning system** that classifies paddy cultivation cases into **High-Risk vs Low-Risk yield outcomes**. Instead of predicting yield as a continuous value, we reframe the problem as a **risk detection** task to support actionable decision-making (e.g., which farms/areas should receive intervention first).
